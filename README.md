Data Understanding:
After getting a quick glance of the data set, we can see that the above data set contains a total of 70 columns and 100,000 rows.
We further went through each column to understand how relevant each column is for the prediction of perfect rating score.
For the purpose of prediction, the team brainstormed, plotted charts, tried different features by trial and error, cleaned over 75 features and finally decided on 63 features to be used as the dependent variables.
